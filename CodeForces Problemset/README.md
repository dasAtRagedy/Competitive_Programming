Solutions to problems I've gone through in Codeforces

How to find the problem itself?<br>
-Either going to my profile on CodeForces>Submissions <b>https://codeforces.com/submissions/Dunix</b><br>
-Or finding the problems by hand:<br>
<b>prob1551B1.cpp</b> is the solution to <b>https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1551/B1</b><br>
<b>prob337A.cpp</b> is the solution to <b>https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/337/A</b><br>
and so on...
